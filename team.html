                <h2>Testimonials</h2>
                <p>“Me and my wife had a sewage/toxic mold case at our apartment complex resulting in personal
                    injury in
                    Orange
                    County, CA. For the course of a year, we had multiple floods in our apartment complex. These
                    floods
                    would
                    impact large portions of our apartment complex and damaged much of our personal property. Each
                    flooding
                    we
                    had in our complex-property management failed to fix the issue and the floodings continued to
                    happen and
                    get
                    worse. After some time, me and my wife started to experience symptoms from mold exposure. We
                    expressed
                    our
                    concerns about mold to the complex and nothing was done. Me and my wife felt stranded and alone.
                    We
                    didn’t
                    know what to do but we knew at our core the way things were being handled was wrong. All the
                    while our
                    symptoms continued to get worse. Me and my wife reached out to MyRightsLaw Group – John, Arie
                    and Bobby
                    took
                    care of us from the start with professionalism and care. Out the gates they made sure we were
                    getting
                    the
                    appropriate medical attention as their first priority. From there they guided us with confidence
                    on the
                    steps to follow. These gentlemen are excellent at their craft and most importantly genuinely
                    care for
                    their
                    clients. They work as a great team and continued to check on us during the entire process. This
                    meant
                    the
                    world to me and my wife. My advice to someone reading this is don’t wait. Reach out to this team
                    at
                    MyRightsLaw Group and get the care you deserve. The weight I felt off my chest during that
                    moment will
                    forever be remembered. John, Arie and Bobby ~ I want to express the utmost gratitude for taking
                    care of
                    me
                    and my family during that very difficult time in our lives. I can’t thank you gentlemen enough.
                    Your
                    professionalism and service were top notch.</p>
                <p>There is a quote by Maya Angelou – “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people
                    will
                    forget
                    what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”</p>
                <p>Thank you for making us feel genuinely cared for, thought of, informed and never once did we feel
                    like a
                    number. God Bless.”</p>

                <p>“My rights law group handled three cases for me, two of my cases were related to a DUI which had
                    a
                    probation
                    violation and the other was for a traffic ticket that had turned into a warrant. They did an
                    excellent
                    job
                    and were able to get the most serious case I had dismissed, as well as quash the warrant for the
                    speeding
                    ticket. Both cases were out of rancho court. Bobby, Arie, and John are great attorneys and they
                    all took
                    interest in my cases. Everything was handled in a timely manner and I was kept informed
                    throughout the
                    process. I’d like to thank My Rights Law Group and the aforementioned attorneys for working on
                    my cases.
                    The
                    only regret I have is not calling them as soon as I got in trouble. I definitely recommend them
                    for any
                    one
                    looking for legal counsel.”</p>
