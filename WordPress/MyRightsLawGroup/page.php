			<p>My Rights Law can help if you were charged with any of the following offenses:</p>
			<div class="alcohol-crime-lawyers">
				<h3>alcohol crimes lawyers</h3>
				<p><a href="">Alcohol crimes</a> can span from driving under the influence (DUI) to underage drinking.
					While drinking
					in many circumstances is a legal activity, depending on the nature and circumstances of alcohol use,
					you may face various alcohol-related charges. My Rights Law’s alcohol crimes lawyers can assist you
					with legal issues concerning:</p>
				<ol class="alcohol-catagory">
					<li>DUI</li>
					<li>Public Intoxication Lawyer</li>
					<li>Open Container</li>
					<li>Selling Alcohol to Minor</li>
					<li>Minor In Possession</li>
					<li>Underage Drinking</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="alcohol-crime-lawyers">
				<h3>violent crimes lawyers</h3>
				<p>The actions that are considered <a href="">violent crimes</a> cover a broad range of activities. For
					example, an assault is regarded as a violent crime. An assault occurs when you attempt to commit a
					violent injury on another person and can perform that threatened injury. While one of the most
					common violent crimes, California law includes many other crimes involving violence. Some of these
					violent crimes include:</p>
				<ol class="alcohol-catagory">
					<li>Battery</li>
					<li>Criminal Threats</li>
					<li>Harassment</li>
					<li>Stalking</li>
					<li>Kidnapping</li>
					<li>Murder</li>
					<li>Elder Abuse</li>
					<li>Animal Cruelty</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="alcohol-crime-lawyers">
				<h3>sex crimes lawyers</h3>
				<p><a href="">Sex crimes</a> involve those crimes involving sexual contact, harm, or other sex-related
					offenses that the state legislature has deemed to be unlawful. As with all areas of law, the
					penalties associated with each kind of offense can vary widely based on the nature and severity of
					the particular crime. Many sex crimes are punished harshly and, if not handled properly, can result
					in severe and life-altering consequences. Common sex crimes and sex crime-related issues include:
				</p>
				<ol class="alcohol-catagory">
					<li> Sexual Assault and Battery</li>
					<li>Indecent Exposure</li>
					<li>Rape</li>
					<li>Possession of Child Pornography</li>
					<li>Pimping</li>
					<li>Solicitation</li>
					<li>Sex Trafficking</li>
					<li>Voyeurism</li>
					<li>Sexual Offender Registration</li>
					<li>Child Molestation</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Due to the sensitive and strictly penalized nature of sex crimes, it is crucial that you seek
					experienced sex crimes representation. My Rights Law’s attorneys have extensive sex crimes
					experience and success in defending against those claims.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="alcohol-crime-lawyers">
				<h3>Domestic violence lawyers</h3>
				<p><a href="">Domestic violence</a> occurs between two parties, those married or cohabitating and living
					in the same dwelling. These issues are sensitive and require diligent representation for effective
					defense. My Rights Law can help you defend against claims of:</p>
				<ol class="alcohol-catagory">
					<li>Domestic Battery</li>
					<li>Spousal Abuse</li>
					<li>Corporal Injury to Spouse or Cohabitant</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="alcohol-crime-lawyers">
				<h3>Theft crimes lawyers</h3>
				<p><a href=""><a href="">Theft crimes</a> generally involve the taking of someone else’s property
						unlawfully. These
						crimes can be relatively minor or, depending on the circumstances of your charge, can have
						substantial far-reaching consequences. The consequences can be as minimal as paying a fine to as
						serious as spending a significant amount of time behind bars. You must take the charges
						seriously, no matter how small or insignificant you think they are. Common theft crimes include:
				</p>
				<ol class="alcohol-catagory">
					<li>Petty Theft</li>
					<li>Grand Theft</li>
					<li>Robbery</li>
					<li>Shoplifting</li>
					<li>Burglary</li>
					<li>Carjacking</li>
					<li>Receiving Stolen Property</li>
					<li>Larceny</li>
					<li>Looting</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="alcohol-crime-lawyers">
				<h3>Property crimes lawyers</h3>
				<p><a href="">Property crimes</a> can involve interference with someone else’s property or damage to
					that property.
					Depending on the severity of the charge, you can face significant monetary penalties or jail time if
					convicted. My Rights Law attorneys can help you defend against these charges and protect your rights
					and interests during those proceedings. Common property crimes include:
				</p>
				<ol class="alcohol-catagory">
					<li>Trespassing</li>
					<li>Arson</li>
					<li>Vandalism</li>
				</ol>
